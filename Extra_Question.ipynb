    "### __Violin Plots__\n",
    "**Purpose**: Violin plots combine aspects of box plots and density plots. They show the distribution of the data and its probability density, making it easier to understand the data's distribution and identify multimodal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Appropriate Uses**: Violin plots are useful for comparing multiple distributions and understanding the underlying distribution shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**: Comparing the distribution of exam scores across different classes where you suspect multiple peaks in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Swarm Plots__\n",
    "**Purpose**: Swarm plots display individual data points while avoiding overlap, allowing for a clear visualization of all data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Appropriate Uses**: Swarm plots are ideal for showing the distribution of small to medium-sized datasets with discrete data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**: Visualizing the distribution of test scores in a class to see the spread and clustering of individual scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Strip Plots__\n",
    "**Purpose**: Strip plots display individual data points and are similar to swarm plots but do not avoid overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Appropriate Uses**: Strip plots are used when you want to see individual data points and their distribution but are not concerned with data overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**: Showing the ages of participants in a survey where the overlap of points is acceptable and does not hinder interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Box Plots__\n",
    "**Purpose**: Box plots summarize data distributions through their quartiles and highlight outliers. They show the median, upper and lower quartiles, and potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Appropriate Uses**: Box plots are useful for comparing distributions and identifying outliers in datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**: Comparing the distribution of salaries across different departments in a company to see the spread and detect any outliers.\n",

    "2. **Statistical Estimation**: Seaborn automatically performs statistical transformations and provides functions to visualize the results, such as confidence intervals and trend lines.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `sns.regplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=tips)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Aggregating Data**: Seaborn can aggregate data across different categories and visualize the aggregate values, making it easier to analyze data trends.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `sns.barplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualizing Distributions**: Seaborn provides several functions to visualize the distribution of data, including histograms, kernel density plots, and violin plots.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `sns.distplot(tips['total_bill'], kde=True)`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Heatmaps**: Seaborn can create heatmaps to display data in a matrix form, which is useful for showing correlations and other relationships in the data.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix)`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pair Plots**: Seaborn can generate a matrix of scatter plots for examining the relationships between multiple variables.\n",

    "### Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Central tendency refers to the statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire dataset. It aims to provide an accurate description of the entire data set with a single value that reflects the center of the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean (Average)**: The mean is the sum of all data points divided by the number of data points.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: \\(\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\\)\n",
    "   - **Example**: For the dataset \\([2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\\):\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Mean} = \\frac{2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11}{5} = \\frac{28}{5} = 5.6\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median**: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest. If the dataset has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "   - **Example**: For the dataset \\([2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\\), the median is 5. For the dataset \\([2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\\), the median is \\(\\frac{5 + 7}{2} = 6\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have more than one mode if multiple values have the same highest frequency.\n",
    "   - **Example**: For the dataset \\([2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 11]\\), the mode is 7 because it appears most frequently.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean** is useful for datasets with values that are evenly distributed but can be affected by outliers.\n",
    "- **Median** is robust to outliers and provides a better central value for skewed distributions.\n",
    "- **Mode** is useful for categorical data to identify the most common category.\n",
