Welcome to the **Data_Visualization_Using_Python** repository! This collection is designed to help you understand and master data visualization using popular Python libraries such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Dive into different questions and their solutions, each accompanied by detailed explanations and beautiful visualizations.

## 🔍 Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- 📈 **Matplotlib Visualizations**: Create various types of plots to visualize your data.
- 🌐 **Seaborn Visualizations**: Enhance your plots with Seaborn for more aesthetically pleasing graphics.
- 📝 **Detailed Explanations**: Understand the code and the concepts behind each visualization.

## 📁 Contents

- **matplotlib_examples/**: Examples and explanations using Matplotlib.
- **seaborn_examples/**: Examples and explanations using Seaborn.
- **data/**: Datasets used for the visualizations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rizwansaifi571/Data_Visualization_Using_Python.git
```

## Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Data_Visualization_Using_Python
```

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

## 🎨 Example Visualizations

Here are some examples of the visualizations you can create:

### 📊 Matplotlib Example
```bash
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]

plt.plot(x, y, marker='o')
plt.title('Sample Plot')
plt.xlabel('X Axis')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis')
plt.show()
```

### 🌐 Seaborn Example
```bash
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
data = sns.load_dataset('iris')

sns.scatterplot(x='sepal_length', y='sepal_width', hue='species', data=data)
plt.title('Iris Dataset - Sepal Length vs Sepal Width')
plt.show()
```
